#' @param sampleSize If a number, x and y are trimmed to this length before being returned using pruneStart. Defaults to NULL which means x and y aren't trimmed.
#' @param reuseInput Forces the use of inputx and inputy as initial values. Defaults to FALSE. Setting this to TRUE is useful for creating animations where the parameters a,b,c and d are varied.
